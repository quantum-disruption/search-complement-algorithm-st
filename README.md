# search-complement-algorithm

In this repository we provide an interactive streamlit dashboard with a modified version of the SKW algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210064) to perform the search complement of a marked node in a $2^n$-dimensional complete graph with self-loops, by decreasing the probability of the quantum state associated to the marked node. The algorithm is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16322v1

Use Qiskit 0.45.3.
